Data Analysis on Maven Movies data using MySQL Workbench.

## prepare environment
1. Open MySQL Workbench and login.
2. Open create_mavenmovies_vApril2022.sql and execute the entire script.
3. Checkout the Maven Movies database thus created.

## The Situation
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner
who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he
has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer
seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

## The Objective
Use MySQL to leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer your potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question will require
you to write a multi table SQL query, joining at least two tables.

## The Letter
Dear Maven Movies Management,<br>
I am excited about the potential acquisition and learning more
about your rental business.<br>
Please<br>
bear with me as I am new to the industry, but I have a
number of questions for you. Assuming you can answer them all,
and that there are no major surprises, we should be able to move
forward with the purchase.<br>
Best,<br>
Martin Moneybags<br>
